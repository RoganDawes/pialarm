Have a Texecom alarm panel? This repository contains scripts and a webserver to speak to the panel over the UART serial ports, ideally from a raspberry pi computer within the alarm panel itself, to provide remote monitoring and alarm escalation over the internet.

The project emultates some of the functionality of Wintex, the Texecom windows-based configuration system, and also uses parts of the Cestron protocol for real-time event monitoring. It will also speak the monitoring protocol to allow the panel to monitor the uptime of the raspberry pi and communicate alarms.

To interface a raspberry Pi to the alarm pannel requires only a couple of resistors, plus a 12-15V DC to 5V DC power adapter. in the hardware directory you will find a small shield fitting the GPIO header to do this, and instructions to connect it to the Texecom main board. It it not necessary to buy any IP-communicator or Com300 board to do this.

### Panel configuration
Configure via. the keypad as follows:

    COM1                        configure as 'Not connected'
    COM2                        configure as 'Cestron'
    COM2 Speed 19200 baud
    COM3                        configure as 'Communicator 300'
    UDL Password -> 12345678    set this in ~/.pialarm

### Preparing the pi
Install a blank `rasbian` install to an SD Card (ideally skipping NOOBS). Boot using a keyboard and screen, then use `sudo raspi-config` to enable ssh (`5 Interfacing Options` -> `P2 SSH` -> `Yes`) then change the password for the `pi` user using `passwd`.

It is necessary to diable the serial `tty` that raspian attaches to `/dev/ttyACM0` in order to have this working. Instructions to do this can be found online, it is a simple matter of running `sudo raspi-config` and disabling the serial tty under `5 Interfacing Options` -> `P6 Serial` -> `No` -> `Yes` -> `OK`, giving this summary:

    The serial login shell is disabled
    The serial interface is enabled  

Now install the contents of this repository to `~/pialarm` as follows:
    
    git clone git@github.com:shuckc/pialarm.git

### Wiring
First I used a couple of FTDI USB external COM ports (5V tolerant) as a proof of concept. However it is much neater to omit these and use the GPIO pins on the pi directly. The COM ports on the alarm mainboard all drive `Tx` to 5V logic levels, with a series protection resistor of ~9.1kOhm, which needs to be accounted for in the voltage divider to reduce to 3.3V logic for the raspberry pi GPIO pins. Since the protection resistor is quite large, I used this as the top resister in the divider chain, with a bottom resistor of 15kOhm. For Rpi -> Pannel, I drove the panel's Rx pin directory with no problems.

For more details see `/hardware`.

### Legal
The protocols were reversed engineered using a Salae Logic8 logic probe, and later by capturing traffic using the `ser2net` tool. See the `traces` directory for these. No author or contributor has signed the Texecom NDA agreement.
